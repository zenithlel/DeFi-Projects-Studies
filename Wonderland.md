<h3> Wonderland Submission for layer3.xyz</h3>


Note that wonderland has gone through many changes and the docs are too outdated. My submission is about the current wonderland not the previous one,

I used wonderland for my own, and I submitted late to be safe. 

Resources: I intereviewed many of wonderland team members, community, This guide was put after careful intereviews with wonderland team in their discord
I was a wonderland user myself, I have been in wonderland community for months  and my blog is a summary that follows the guide 


Note: 
`the current wonderland Docs are outdated, this description describes the current wonderland project. after the change as the previous products are not in the new wonderland build, currently wonderland is a fund that provides investment revenue sharing`
