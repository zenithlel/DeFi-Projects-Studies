`In the following link i put in a summarized version explaining how the protocol works, 
I saw the guidelines hours before the deadline thankfully I managed to edit
my guide to an unbiased, simple and short so a second-language speaker can understand`



I hope this qualifies, Wonderland had a lot history that I wrote a whole topic about it
I used wonderland for my own.

Resources: I intereviewed many of wonderland team members, community, This guide was put after careful intereviews with wonderland team in their discord

Note: 
`the current wonderland Docs are outdated, this description describes the current wonderland and wonderland docs will be changed soon`

<h3> History of wonderland "In details" : </h3>


In the following Google docs, the history of changes that happened in wonderland in full details. Many events that happened as the protocol went through it and still
is one of the top TVL projects in Avalanche and the only project that does revenue sharing 
Honestly, Even this is still a little as the project had a lot of changes and writing about it needs a book not a 2 page blog xD
