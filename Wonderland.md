<h3> Wonderland Submission for layer3.xyz</h3>


I hope this qualifies, Wonderland had a lot history that I wrote a whole topic about it.

I used wonderland for my own, and I submitted late to be safe. 

Resources: I intereviewed many of wonderland team members, community, This guide was put after careful intereviews with wonderland team in their discord
I was a wonderland user myself, I have been in wonderland community for months  and my blog is a summary that follows the guide 


Note: 
`the current wonderland Docs are outdated, this description describes the current wonderland project. `

<h3> History of wonderland "In details" : </h3>
Note : `this isn't included in the layer3 submission, this is a draft for the submission`

In the following Google docs, the history of changes that happened in wonderland in full details. Many events that happened as the protocol went through it and still
is one of the top TVL projects in Avalanche and the only project that does revenue sharing 
Honestly, Even this is still a little as the project had a lot of changes and writing about it needs a book not a 2 page blog xD
